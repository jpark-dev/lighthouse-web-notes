## What does -u option do when pushing Git?

-u option seems like it sets the upstream path, so that future CLI such as

```
git push
```

instead of 

```
git push origin master
```

can be executed. However, it seems like git push does not always work,
so I guess the best practice at this moment is to push origin to master,
or read more of the git manual.
